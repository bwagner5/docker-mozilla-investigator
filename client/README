To run use `docker run -it mig/client`

This will load a docker container with the mig-console running. It will prompt you for the GPG password (which is `mig` for sample purposes). 

You can then create an investigator with the following steps:

  - `create investigator`
  - Enter any name for the investigator
  - Enter path to a public key (you can use a sample provided one at `/root/mig_investigator_pubkey.asc`)
  - And enter `y` to confirm creation
  - Note the id provided for further lookups

GPG Key Password is `mig` with email mig@mig.com
